## 🧪 Example

### 🔢 Input

#### `Visits` Table:

| `visit_id` | `customer_id` |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 1          | 23             |
| 2          | 9              |
| 4          | 30             |
| 5          | 54             |
| 6          | 96             |
| 7          | 54             |
| 8          | 54             |

#### `Transactions` Table:

| `transaction_id` | `visit_id` | `amount` |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 2                | 5          | 310      |
| 3                | 5          | 300      |
| 9                | 5          | 200      |
| 12               | 1          | 910      |
| 13               | 2          | 970      |

---

### ✅ Output

| `customer_id` | `count_no_trans` |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| 54            | 2                |
| 30            | 1                |
| 96            | 1                |

> 💡 **Explanation**:
>
> * ✅ Customer `54` visited 3 times, but only one visit had transactions → **2 no-transaction visits**.
> * ✅ Customer `30` visited once, with no transactions.
> * ✅ Customer `96` visited once, with no transactions.
> * ❌ Customers `23` and `9` each made at least one transaction during their only visit.
